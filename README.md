Incredibly, we are going to make a mobile application.

As students we know the constant distractions we are surrounded by who don't allow us to focus. Therefore, we are going to build an all-in-one app so that you don't need to move through your phone and click on an ad, a message from your ex-girlfriend or a football match score.

Wish us luck (and patience)!
