As students we know the constant distractions we are surrounded and don't allow us to focus.
Therefore, we are going to build an all-in-one app so that you don't need to move through your phone and click on an ad,
a message from your ex-girlfriend or a football match score.
This app will guide you through the complete process of study: from the organisation of the tasks to a suitable study-rest balance.
Moreover, a simple UI will allow you to focus on the important, not allowing getting distractued by fancy transitions or
gifs.
Finally, a built-in music widget with several lo-fi style music will help you through your pleasant (or not that pleasant)
progress to keep your mind at peace.
We wish this app will help you.
Enjoy!
